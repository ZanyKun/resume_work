Feelings/Ideas Purple Conveys

When I think of purple, I think of Easter when purple is a prominent
color at the time. Though purple may have some of its significance tied
to the Christian religion due to this holiday, the color carries a 
different tone in outside of it. The color can be “spans both warm and 
cool and can create a different mood depending on the colors it’s 
combined with” (Farley). A dark purple combined with red can be 
considered a warm color, whereas light purples can be considered cool 
colors. Either warm or cool, purple carries a feeling of wealth and 
prosperity with it.  


How Purple is Used

Purple can be used in contrasting color schemes to make something 
stand out. For example, a purple background can highlight a special 
section of a website that is color in a lighter, contrasting color. 
Purple is mainly used for company website’s “that [feature] niche, 
luxury products” (Barker). This is due to purple conveying that feeling 
of wealth and prosperity as stated before.
