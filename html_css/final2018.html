				&quot;The color I will be discussing is the color purple. The color purple in the real world is associated mostly with religion, mainly the Christian religion as it is used during Easter. Purple, within a website, is used to convey a feeling of prosperity and refined tastes. This is why certain companies such as Cradbury Eggs and Lindor Chocolates use purple as way to convey that their products are in a different level above the rest.&quot;

				The course definitely gives you an experience into what it is like to be a web developer. I definitely liked the whole process of you being our &quot;client&quot; for Project II and talking to us about what you were looking for from the group in general and making us adhere to the project proposal. This is something I would definitely like to do on the side in the future for sure and something I would not want to forget any time soon because it is fun. I learned to rely on my teammates for sure. I'm the type of person who usually likes to do projects by myself because I have a higher standard for my work that some people are not at but Project II was definitely not a one person job. I am glad I had the teammates I did because they all held up their weight, I just brought their work up to my standards by the end of it. However, it was a nice learning experience that sometimes teammates can be great.
