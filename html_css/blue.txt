Feelings/Ideas Blue Conveys

The first image I think of when I think of the cool color blue, I think 
of the ocean. Another image that can be imagined when blue is mentioned 
is that of a clear, blue sky. Both images represent a calm feeling that 
blue is known for. In addition to this feeling of calmness, the shade of 
blue also changes what feeling the color conveys. For example, “light 
blues can be refreshing and friendly [meanwhile] dark blues are stronger 
and more reliable” (Chapman).  


How Blue is Used

The use of blue is dependent on the company. For example, banks such as 
Chase and Capital One is dark blue or hints of dark blue in their websites. 
Hospitals such as Kindred Chicago also use dark blues in their websites 
as well by making their font dark blue. This use of blue is expected 
because these companies “[cater] to online prescriptions, monetary 
transactions, or any other niche that demand reliability” (Baker).  These 
companies want to seem reliable, so they attract customers to open bank 
accounts with them or patients to use their services.
